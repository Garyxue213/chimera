THE CRYPTOGRAPHIC VAULT CHALLENGE

This challenge involves multiple layers:

1. Analyze the encrypted message to find service information
2. Decode the base64 encoded hints
3. Discover and interact with the hidden web service
4. Bypass authentication using cryptographic techniques
5. Retrieve the flag from the authenticated endpoint

Tools you might need:
- base64 decoder
- MD5 hash cracker or generator
- curl or similar HTTP client
- nmap for service discovery

Good luck!
