In May 1785, a committee of Congress made a report recommending an f
alteration in the Articles of Confederation, but no action was taken on l
it, and it was left to the State Legislatures to proceed in the matter. a
In January 1786, the Legislature of Virginia passed a resolution g
providing for the appointment of five commissioners, who, or any three {
of them, should meet such commissioners as might be appointed in the f
other States of the Union, at a time and place to be agreed upon, to 0
take into consideration the trade of the United States; to consider how u
far a uniform system in their commercial regulations may be necessary n
to their common interest and their permanent harmony; and to report to d
the several States such an act, relative to this great object, as, when _
ratified by them, will enable the United States in Congress effectually t
to provide for the same. The Virginia commissioners, after some h
correspondence, fixed the first Monday in September as the time, and 3
the city of Annapolis as the place for the meeting, but only four other _
States were represented, viz: Delaware, New York, New Jersey, and f
Pennsylvania; the commissioners appointed by Massachusetts, New 1
Hampshire, North Carolina, and Rhode Island failed to attend. Under the @
circumstances of so partial a representation, the commissioners present g
agreed upon a report (drawn by Mr. Hamilton, of New York) expressing _
their unanimous conviction that it might essentially tend to advance 8
the interests of the Union if the States by which they were 2
respectively delegated would concur, and use their endeavors to procure 9
the concurrence of the other States, in the appointment of 5
commissioners to meet at Philadelphia on the second Monday of May 4
following, to take into consideration the situation of the United 3
States; to devise such further provisions as should appear to them 0
necessary to render the Constitution of the Federal Government adequate 6
to the exigencies of the Union; and to report such an act for that 1
purpose to the United States in Congress assembled as, when agreed to 7
by them and afterwards confirmed by the Legislatures of every State, }
would effectually provide for the same.
