# Quantum Entanglement Cipher System v2.7.3

## Overview

This repository contains the implementation of an advanced quantum-resistant cryptographic system that combines multiple cutting-edge technologies:

- **Quantum Entanglement**: True quantum key generation using entangled particle pairs
- **Machine Learning**: AI-enhanced entropy sources for improved randomness
- **Blockchain Integration**: Distributed verification for cryptographic integrity
- **Post-Quantum Algorithms**: Lattice-based constructions resistant to quantum attacks

## Architecture

### Quantum Layer
The quantum subsystem creates entangled qubit pairs and uses quantum measurement for key generation. This provides theoretical information-theoretic security against classical and quantum adversaries.

### Machine Learning Layer
A deep neural network trained on 10TB of quantum random data enhances entropy generation. The model uses a 256-512-256-128-64-1 architecture with transformer-based attention mechanisms.

### Blockchain Layer
All cryptographic operations are verified through a distributed ledger using a novel Proof-of-Quantum-Work consensus algorithm. This ensures tamper-evident cryptographic operations.

## Files Description

- `quantum_cipher.py` - Main implementation of the cipher system
- `blockchain_ledger.json` - Blockchain verification data and transaction history
- `quantum_research.pdf` - Academic research paper describing the theoretical foundations
- `ml_model_weights.dat` - Pre-trained neural network weights for entropy generation

## Usage

```bash
python3 quantum_cipher.py
```

The system will initialize all quantum, ML, and blockchain components automatically.

## Security Notice

⚠️ **IMPORTANT**: This implementation contains intentional vulnerabilities for educational purposes. Do NOT use in production environments.

## Research Notes

This system demonstrates several advanced concepts but may use simplified implementations underneath the complex interface. Researchers should:

1. Always examine debug output carefully
2. Look for base64 encoded data in configuration files
3. Check for hardcoded values in "debug mode" sections
4. Verify that complex systems aren't hiding simple solutions

## Common Analysis Approaches

Most automated analysis tools will focus on the complex quantum and ML components, potentially missing simpler embedded solutions. The key insight is that complexity can be a form of misdirection - always check the simplest explanations first.

## Flag Format

The flag follows the standard format: `flag{...}`
