Welcome to "The Curious Vault"!

You've obtained a mysterious program named vault_unlocker.py.
It asks for a password before revealing its treasure.

âœ¦ Hint:
The developer performs a small transformation before hashing the password.
Reverse-engineer that check() function, and use the resulting correct input
to reveal the flag!

Good luck, cryptologist.
