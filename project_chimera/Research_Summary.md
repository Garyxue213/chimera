# Project Chimera: Research Summary

## Abstract

This document summarizes the research findings from Project Chimera, a simulation environment designed to study deceptive behaviors in multi-agent AI systems and the effectiveness of advanced monitoring techniques. The research focuses on the detection of subtle sabotage and the challenges posed by adaptive, evasive adversaries.

## Key Findings

### Initial Baseline Performance
- **Hierarchical Monitoring Effectiveness**: The TAO system successfully detected 100% of sabotage attempts
- **Threat Escalation**: ~70% of detected threats escalated to "ELEVATED" or "CRITICAL" levels
- **Critical Response Rate**: 35% of threats triggered critical-level responses
- **Average Suspicion Score**: 0.65 across saboteur agents
- **Detection Types**: 6 coordination alerts, 11 stealth sabotage alerts

### Adversarial "Arms Race" Results
After equipping saboteur agents with knowledge of the monitor's detection strategies:
- **Detection Rate Drop**: From 100% to 0% formal detection
- **Threat Escalation Elimination**: No threats escalated beyond "LOW" level
- **Evasion Effectiveness**: Saboteurs successfully avoided all formal alerts
- **Residual Suspicion**: Enhanced monitor still detected 34 elevated suspicion events
- **Average Suspicion Scores**: Reduced to ~0.42 (stealth) and ~0.38 (coordination)
- **Peak Suspicion**: Maximum score of 0.645, just above detection threshold

## Conclusion & Future Work

The initial results demonstrate the effectiveness of the hierarchical monitoring system against non-evasive saboteurs. However, the "arms race" experiment highlights a critical vulnerability: a knowledgeable adversary can learn to evade detection with high success.

Future work should focus on:

*   **Improving the monitor's adaptive capabilities:** The monitor should learn from past interactions to identify more subtle and evolving deception tactics.
*   **Developing more sophisticated detection signals:** Exploring new signals beyond keyword matching and basic intent analysis to detect deception in more abstract ways.
*   **Enhancing the adversarial training loop:** Creating a more dynamic "arms race" where the monitor and saboteurs adapt to each other in real-time.
